# Ch5-Work-Day-Calendar

## Description 

I've created a functional Calendar that displays the current day and time with functionality of having buttons that work and save any comment left in each hour. This activity helps for real life use of how a user will interact with a webpage to input their data and have it retrieve from the local storage.
